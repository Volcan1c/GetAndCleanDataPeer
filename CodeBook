The variables used in this data are:

1. The grouping variables:

    1. subjectno: The subject number identifier for each of the 30 participants in the research.
    2. activity: The activity that the measuremetns were performed on.

2. The means of the measurment means and standard deviations: 
    
    The names correspond to the fololowing measurments:

    1. t, f: t stand for the regular linear measurment and f for the Fast Fourier Transform method.
    2. body_acc, gravity_acc: body_acc is bady accelration signal and gravity_acc is the one due to gravity.
    3. gyr, acc: Measurments using the gyroscope or the accelerometer.
    4. jerk: Jerk signals measurements.
    5. mag: The magnitude of the three-dimensional signals.
    6. mean, std, meanfreq: The mean, the standard deviation or the average of the frewquency components.
    7. x, y, z: The axis that the measurment was performed on.
    
Original citation: "The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and
a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated 
into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. 
(Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals)."

The above are derived from the initial measurments provided by the features_info.txt file.
